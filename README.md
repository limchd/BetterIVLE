BetterIVLE Chrome extension
for the new NUS IVLE interface

<h2>To install</h2>
<ul><li>Install via the Chrome Web Store, or</li>
<li>download everything, enable developer mode in Chrome and load the folder. (unrecommended)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Descriptive page titles</li>
<li>What's New page now highlights what you missed since your last visit to that page</li>
<li>Workbin now has a folder browser like in Classic IVLE</li>
<li>Minor CSS tweaks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
BIVLE is not meant to be an overhaul of the new IVLE interface, but a speedier testbed of easy, hackish solutions meant to augment some of its lacking features.
The new IVLE is still in development after all, and you can still post your feedback on the IVLE forum.

<h2>Feedback</h2>
All feedback and contributions are most welcome!
