BetterIVLE Userscript
for the "new" NUS IVLE

This is a userscript, meaning it runs within your browser whenever you visit IVLE.

<h2>To install</h2>
<ol><li>You will need the Tampermonkey (Chrome) or Greasemonkey (Firefox) extensions.</li>
<li>Download and add the userscript.js file. Failing which, you can create a new userscript and copy its contents over.</li>
<li>Enable the userscript in Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.</li>
<li>BIVLE should work its magic!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Descriptive page titles</li>
<li>What's New page now highlights what you missed since your last visit to that page</li>
<li>Workbin now has a folder browser like in Classic IVLE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
BIVLE is not meant to be an overhaul of the new IVLE interface, but a speedier testbed of easy, hackish solutions meant to augmenting some of its more lacking parts.
The new IVLE is still in development after all, and you can still post your feedback on the IVLE forum.

<h2>Feedback</h2>
All feedback and contributions are welcome.
